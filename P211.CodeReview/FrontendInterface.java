 * This is the interface that a frontend developer will implement.  It will
 * enable users to access the functionality exposed by the BackendInterface.
 *
 * Notice the organization of the methods below into pairs that generate HTML
 * strings that 1) prompt the user for input to perform a specific computation,
 * and then 2) make use of that input with the help of the backend, to compute
 * and then display the requested results.
 *
 * A webapp will be developed later in this project to integrate these html
 * snippets into a webpage that is returned custom build in response to each
 * user request.
